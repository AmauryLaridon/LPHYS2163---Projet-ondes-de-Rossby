This project was carried out by Élise Francoisse, Augustin Lambotte and Amaury Laridon for the course LPHYS2163: Atmosphere and ocean - physics and dynamics.
The goal is to simulate Rossby waves in the atmosphere.

The project instructions with more explanation on the framework imposed for the digital implementation can be found in the document: Project2_LPHYS2163.pdf

The project report highlighting the key results as well as various sensitivity analyzes can be found at the following address: https://fr.overleaf.com/read/rstmtfpgtwhn

The executable code written in python can be found in the simu.py file
The variables have all been moved to the beginning of the code and the use of functions has been made as much as possible in order to be able to easily decide the scenario in which we want to run the simulation. The variables and different elements of the code are normally sufficiently documented and commented to be able to run it easily. The different final display functions that the user decides to activate or not can be found at the very end of the code in the “executable” part.

All the different figures and animations deemed interesting during the various tests were classified in the files of the same name.
